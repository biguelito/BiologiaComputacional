Table. Estimates of Evolutionary Divergence between Sequences
The number of base differences per site between sequences is shown. The analytical procedure encompassed 5 nucleotide sequences. The pairwise deletion option was applied to all ambiguous positions for each sequence pair resulting in a final data set comprising 874 positions. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA12 [1].
